That our inherited DNA is the only determinator of who we are, biologically. But around 1990 the epigenetic science gained speed, and scientists started to get interested in the cellular mechanisms that can regulate our genes in different ways. Our ambition is to highlight the holistic connection between mind and body, and how they impact one another. How can epigenetics and quantum physics help us understand that if we change the way we think and feel, we can influence our internal and external environment?",
